# LearningResourcesApp

To contribute to the platform, simply provide the title, description, and link of the resource you wish to share in the "Add Resource" section.

In the "Stored Resource" section, you can explore the collection of resources shared by others. It enables you to discover a wide range of information from various sources, making it easier to access and learn from different perspectives.

In addition to the features mentioned earlier, Learning Resources App also provides a history of deleted resources. This means that even if a resource is removed or deleted from the platform, you can still access its details and view its history.

By maintaining a record of deleted resources, the app ensures that valuable information is not lost completely. It allows users to revisit and reference previously shared resources, even if they have been removed from the active listing.
